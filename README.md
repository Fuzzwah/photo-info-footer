# photo-info-footer
A python script that reads exif data from an image file and saves a copy of the file with a footer displaying date and location information.

## Current State:

It works on my machine.

## TODO:

- rig up configurable options:
  - transparency
  - background colour
  - font color
  - font
  - date format
  - which exif fields to include in footer
  - text location (left, right, center)
